	default n
	help
	  Select this option to enable the legacy stpio interface. No
	  code within the kernel uses this API, it is retained only for
	  drivers outside the kernel which might still need it.

config STM_COPROCESSOR_CLASS
	tristate "STMicroelectronics coprocessor support"
	select FW_LOADER
	select BPA2
	select LIBELF_32
	---help---
	  Many of the ST system-on-chip devices have multiple CPUs, where a
	  master CPU running Linux has control over a number of slave CPUs,
	  which are usually used to run dedicated algorithms.
	  Enabling this option will add support to the Linux kernel to
	  control these slave CPUs, reserve memory for them, and thus allow
	  code to be downloaded onto them and executed.

	  Memory allocation is managed through BPA2 so, to define a
	  coprocessor's memory size and address, use the normal BPA2
	  command line option:
	    bpa2_parts=<name0>:<size0>:<address0>,<name1>:<size1>:<address1>,...
	  where:
	    <nameX> is "coproc_" followed by the coprocessor name, for example
	    "audio0".
	    <sizeX> defines the size of the partition
	    <addressX> defines the base address of memory reserved for the
	    coprocessor application code and data.

	  For example:
	    bpa2_parts=coproc_video0:16m:0x06000000,coproc_audio0:16m:0x07000000

	  As with all other BPA2 addresses, addresses are physical addresses,
	  and so may appear at different virtual addresses when mapped into the
	  CPU's memory map.

config STM_COPROCESSOR_ST40
	tristate "ST40 coprocessor support"
	depends on STM_COPROCESSOR_CLASS
	---help---
	  Provide support for ST40 coprocessor hardware.

	---help---
	  Provide support for ST200 coprocessor hardware.

config  COPROCESSOR_DEBUG
        depends on STM_COPROCESSOR_CLASS
        bool "STM coprocessor debug"
        default n
        ---help---
          Enable this option to print out information about the slave CPUs
          addresses and operations you are using for coprocessor.

config STM_RNG
       bool "STM Random Number Generator Support"
       default y
       ---help---
         This option adds support for the hardware Random Number Generator
         (RNG) present on different STMicroelectronics SoCs.  It allows the
         RNG to feed /dev/random with entropy thereby ensuring real
         random numbers from this device.

         Without this option, /dev/random has little entropy and is not
         useful.  In fact, it may block for a long time while waiting for
         entropy.

         This option should always be enabled for relevant SoCs.

         This option can be used in conjunction with the /dev/hw_random
         driver found in the char drivers menu.

config STM_HAS_MALI
	def_bool n

config STM_MALI
	depends on STM_HAS_MALI

config STM_MALI_OS_MEMORY_SIZE
	depends on STM_MALI
	hex "Maximum Mali GPU OS memory size"
	default "0x7800000"
	---help---
	  Specify the size of memory which the Mali driver is allowed to
	  allocate from Linux kernel.
	  
config STM_MALI_DEBUG

	bool "Enable debug tracing"
	default y
	---help---
	  Enable this option to enable debug trace messages on the console

config STM_AMBA_BRIDGE

config STM_IRQ_MUX
	depends on STM_DRIVERS
	bool "STM IRQ-Mux support"
	default n
	---help---
	  Enable this option to support IRQ-MUX mapping in the kernel.
