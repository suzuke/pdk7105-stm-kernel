* Integrated SoC Virtual Ethernet driver

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "st,isve"
- reg: Address and length of the downstream and upstream register set
- interrupts: Should contain downstream and upstream interrupts
- interrupt-names: Should contain the interrupt names "isveirq_ds", "isveirq_us"
		   so the downstream and upstream interrupt names.

Optional properties:
isve,downstream_queue_size	Downstream queue size
isve,upstream_queue_size	Upstream queue size
isve,queue_number		Number of the queue
isve,skip_hdr			Extra bytes to remove (also in case of the
				HW is programmed to remove both extra and docsis
				headers from the incoming frames) to keep the
				Ethernet frame aligned to 32bit.
isve,hw_rem_hdr			This can be 1 to remove the docsis header,
				2 to remove the extra header and 3 to remove
				all the headers.
isve,ifname			This is to override the default interface name
				for example if17, if18, if19 and if1 commonly
				used on our SoCs for eCM etc.

Examples:
	if17:isve_queue_3 {
			compatible	= "st,isve", "simple-bus";
			status = "disabled";
			device_type = "network";
			reg = <0xfee2e460 0x20>, <0xfee1a478 0x20>;
			interrupts = <0 78 0>, <0 89 0>;
			interrupt-names = "isveirq_ds", "isveirq_us";

			isve,downstream_queue_size = <32>;
			isve,upstream_queue_size = <32>;
			isve,queue_number = <3>;
			isve,skip_hdr = <0x2>; /* two extra bytes have to be removed */
			isve,hw_rem_hdr = <0x3>; /* remove docsis and extra HDR */
			isve,ifname = "if17";
		};
